This app will give you a result whether a tumor of breast cancer is benign or maglinant. Users will enter required information based on the best predictor of this model.

## Inputs ##
* Age: patient's age in years (integer)(required)
* Shape: mass shape: round=1 oval=2 lobular=3 irregular=4 (nominal)(required)
* Margin: mass margin: circumscribed=1 microlobulated=2 obscured=3 ill-defined=4 spiculated=5 (nominal)(required)
* Density: mass density high=1 iso=2 low=3 fat-containing=4 (ordinal)(required)
* Androgen History: yes=1 no=0
* Previous visit: yes=1 no=0
* Blood Group: A=1 B=2 AB=3 O=4
